# Arduino-Bits-and-Bytes

### PizzaBox - SimRacing Controller
> This project utilizes an Arduino Pro Micro and is designed to work with/consolidate a Logitech H-Shifter, an Analog Handbrake, and an 11 Toggle Switch/Push Button Box. This code is currently being well used alongside a Thrustmaster T300 RS with no issues in: Assetto Corsa, Project Cars 1-3, Forza Horizon 4 & 5. 

### PizzaBox - Midi Controller
> Based on the famous MidiFighter controller, this code is developed to be used with a 4x4 grid of preferably arcade buttons, a 128x32 i2c OLED screen, and an Arduino Pro Micro. Added features include A to G Major/Minor Key changing and Octive changing through a built in menu system. The controller also supports multiple inputs for playing chords!

### Keypad Midi Controller
> I orginally developed this to create a credit card sized feature rich midi controller to use on-the-go with my phone. The project was eventually shelved to work on another project. In it's current state, the code supports an Arduino Pro Micro, a 128x32 i2c OLED screen, 4x4 Matrix Array Tactile or Membrane Keypads, and a potentiometer. The keypad is limited to a C-Major Scale and can only accept one key press at a time. The potentiometer is used to change Octives. There were plans to utilize an additional potentiometer to change Scales and a button to change modes of the potentiometers from Note Adjustment to Analog Input.
